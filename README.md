# Thesis Template

Basic template for reports, bachelor and master theses at the [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/).


## A few tips for writing your thesis:

- Use UTF-8 encoding on your files to make special characters wörk.
- Write one sentence per line -- this makes for nice diffs in git.
- Keep your literature up to date -- add references to your bib file as you read them.
